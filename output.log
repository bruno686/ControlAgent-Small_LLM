Iteration 5 for system 8 scenario fast

{'design': "[Step1] Choose a proper loop bandwidth ω_L. To get an approximate value, you should typically consult a performance chart for the specific plant type. For this system, let's assume that ω_L = 7.0. ω_L represents the frequency at which the magnitude of the frequency response is 1 (G_L(jω) = 1). It is important to note that this value is an estimate, and the exact value might vary from the performance chart but provide a good starting point.\\n[Step2] Select the proportional gain K_p to set the desired loop bandwidth ω_L, where K_p = \\\\(±1 / |G(j\\omega_L)|\\\\). Let's assume a reasonable initial value of K_p = 1/(|G(jω_L)I with the initial value: 1/|G(jω_L)| = 1/|0.8*Re(ω_j) + 0.6*Im(ω_j)| with arbitrary value. Let’s choose a small offset for our initial value, say K_p = 1/(1 + 0.05) = 0.95.\\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (β_b * s + ω_L) / (s * sqrt(β_b^2 + 1)) with β_b = 1.0. Increasing β_b to 10 improves low frequency performance but introduces phase shift at crossover. This leads to a phase margin increase and lower high frequency gain. In our case, β_b = 10 is overkill and will make the phase margin too high, causing more aggressive control on noise and disturbance rejection, thus no need to increase it. Suppose initially we have β_b = 1.0. Adjust β_b to something reasonable like β_b = 1.5 to get the right balance between phase margin and low-frequency performance. Hence once the accuracy is assured, you can increase it / decrease it to reach the desired performance target.", 'parameter': [7.0, 1.0, 2.0]}

Let’s choose a small offset for our initial value, say K_p = 1/(1 + 0.05) = 0.95.\\n[Step3] Design an integral boost to increase the low frequency loop gain thus improving both tracking and disturbance rejection at low frequencies. Specifically, select K_i (s) = (β_b * s + ω_L) / (s * sqrt(β_b^2 + 1)) with β_b = 1.0. Increasing β_b to 10 improves low frequency performance but introduces phase shift at crossover. This leads to a phase margin increase and lower high frequency gain. In our case, β_b = 10 is overkill and will make the phase margin too high, causing more aggressive control on noise and disturbance rejection, thus no need to increase it. Suppose initially we have β_b = 1.0. Adjust β_b to something reasonable like β_b = 1.5 to get the right balance between phase margin and low-frequency performance.
